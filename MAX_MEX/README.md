Given an array N and an integer X with operation to add and substract X from any element in the array. 
Find the maximum possible MEX from the array with the any number of operation above!!


ps: The MEX of an array is equal to the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array. For example, MEX(1,2,4,2,3,6,7) = 5.

    
- Example 1
```
Input:
arr = [3,4,5]
x = 1

output:
3
```

- Example 2
```
input:
arr = [1,1,1]
x = 2

output: 0
```
