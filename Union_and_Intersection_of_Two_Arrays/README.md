Given two unsorted arrays that represent two sets (elements in every array are distinct), 
find union and intersection of two arrays.

For example, if the input arrays are:
```
arr1[] = {7, 1, 5, 2, 3, 6}
arr2[] = {3, 8, 6, 20, 7}
Then your program should print Union as {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20} and Intersection as {3, 6}. 
```

Note that the elements of union and intersection can be printed in any order.
