A robot is located at the top-left corner(0,0) of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner(m-1, n-1) of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?
