FactorCombination
=============
By multiplying all individual digit of one number(positive integer) which is at leaset 2-digit, we can obtain another number, For example:
    
    327 --> 42 --> 8

On the other hand, given one number, this number could be the product of all individual digit of one number or more than one numbers, For example

    29 --> 18 or 92 --> 18 or 63 --> 18 or ...

Given one number. Please find out the min number which the product of all individual digit of this number is the given number. For example, given 18, then 29 is the min number which the product of all individual digit can produce 18. If this min number doesn't exist, please return -1.

## Given number --> Min number
Please print the answers like below:

(1) 18 --> 29

(2) 42 --> 67

(3) 100 --> 455

(4) 51 --> -1

(5) 1 --> 10

(6) 105 --> 357
