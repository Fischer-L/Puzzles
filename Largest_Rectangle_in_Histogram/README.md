Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.

<img src="./histogram.png" width="150" />

Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = `[2,1,5,6,2,3]`.

<img src="./histogram_area.png" width="150" />

The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.

Example:
```
Input: [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
```
