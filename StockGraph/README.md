Stock Graph
==================

Your mission is to draw stock graph. You will be given a string consisting of "R"(Rise), "F"(Fall) and "C"(Constant) character.
"R" means that stock rises. "F" means that stock falls. "C" means that stock holds constant.

### Graph Rules

As encounting "R", print "/"(slash) to draw a rising line for stock rising; "\"(backslash) for stock falling; "_"(underscore) for constant stock.
